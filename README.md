This project is about classifying Orange and Apple fruit based on support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.
It contains the following script in two main file:
1. Preparing datasheet 
2. Training SVM model 
3. Evaluating SVM classifier model
4. Saving SVM train model
5. testing the saved SVM model in realtime using raspberry pi camera

Requirements:
1. dataset image for orange and apple class
2. Libraries e.g sklearn package, numpy, opencv etc.
3. raspberry pi camera 
4. raspberry pi ( your choice for model type but prefer raspberry pi 4 model B with faster processor)

A video demontration on this can be found at: https://youtu.be/IHFCdor68Iw

For reporting bugs or help regarding any aspect of the SVM algorithm, please email: clarida045@gmail.com
