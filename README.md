This project is about classifying Orange and Apple fruit based on support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.
It contains the following script:
1. Preparing datasheet 
2. Training SVM model 
3. Evaluating SVM classifier model
4. Saving SVM train model
5. testing the SVM saved model in realtime using raspberry pi camera

Requirements:
1. dataset image for orange and apple class
2. Libraries e.g sklearn package
3. raspberry pi camera 
4. raspberry pi ( your choice for model type but prefer raspberry pi 4 model B with faster RAM)
